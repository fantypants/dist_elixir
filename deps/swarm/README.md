# Swarm

[![Hex.pm Version](http://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/swarm.svg?style=flat)](https://hex.pm/packages/swarm)

**NOTE**: If you are upgrading from 1.0, be aware that the autoclustering functionality has been extracted
to it's own package, which you will need to depend on if you use that feature.
The package is [libcluster](http://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster) and is available on Hex. Please
be sure to read over the README to make sure your config is properly updated.

Swarm is a global distributed registry, offering a feature set similar to that of `gproc`,
but architected to handle dynamic node membership and large volumes of process registrations
being created/removed in short time windows.

To be more clear, Swarm was born out of the need for a global process registry which could
handle large numbers of persistent processes representing devices/device connections, which
needed to be distributed around a cluster of Erlang nodes, and easily found. Messages need
to be routed to those processes from anywhere in the cluster, both individually, and as groups;
and additionally, those processes need to be shifted around the cluster based on cluster topology
changes, or restarted if their owning node goes down.

Before writing Swarm, I tried both `global` and `gproc`, but the former is not very flexible, and
both of them require leader election, which in the face of dynamic node membership and the sheer
volume of registrations, ended up causing deadlocks/timeouts during leadership contention.

I also attempted to use `syn`, but because it uses `mnesia`, dynamic node membership as a requirement
means it's dead on arrival for my use case.

In short, are you running a cluster of Erlang nodes under something like Kubernetes? If so, Swarm is
for you!

## Installation

```elixir
defp deps do
  [{:swarm, "~> 3.0"}]
end
```

## Features

- automatic distribution of registered processes across
  the cluster based on a consistent hashing algorithm,
  where names are partitioned across nodes based on their hash.
- easy handoff of processes between one node and another, including
  handoff of current process state. You may indicate whether the
  handoff should simply restart the process on the new node, start
  the process and then send it the handoff message containing state,
  or ignore the handoff and remain on it's current node.
- can do simple registration with `{:via, :swarm, name}`
- both an Erlang and Elixir API

## Restrictions

- auto-balancing of processes in the cluster require registrations be done via
  `register_name/4`, which takes module/function/args params, and handles starting
  the process for you. The MFA must return `{:ok, pid}`.
  This is how Swarm handles process handoff between nodes, and automatic restarts when nodedown
  events occur and the cluster topology changes.


## Consistency Guarantees

Like any distributed system, a choice must be made in terms of guarantees provided.
Swarm favors availability over consistency, even though it is eventually consistent, as network partitions,
when healed, will be resolved by asking any copies of a given name that live on nodes where they don't
belong to shutdown.

Network partitions result in all partitions running an instance of processes created with Swarm.
Swarm was designed for use in an IoT platform, where process names are generally based on physical device ids,
and as such, the consistency issue is less of a problem. If events get routed to two separate partitions,
it's generally not an issue if those events are for the same device. However this is clearly not ideal
in all situations. Swarm also aims to be fast, so registrations and lookups must be as low latency as possible,
even when the number of processes in the registry grows very large. This is acheived without consensus by using
a consistent hash of the name which deterministically defines which node a process belongs on, and all requests
to start a process on that node will be serialized through that node to prevent conflicts.

## Clustering

Swarm pre-2.0 included auto-clustering functionality, but that has been split out into it's own package,
[libcluster](https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster). Swarm works out of the box with Erlang's distribution
tools (i.e. `Node.connect/1`, `:net_adm.connect_node/1`, etc.), but if you need the auto-clustering that Swarm
previously provided, you will need to add `:libcluster` to your deps, and make sure it's in your applications
list *before* `:swarm`. Some of the configuration has changed slightly in `:libcluster`, so be sure to review
the docs.

### Node Blacklisting/Whitelisting

You can explicitly whitelist or blacklist nodes to prevent certain nodes from being included in Swarm's consistent
hash ring. This is done with either the `node_whitelist` and `node_blacklist` settings respectively. These settings
must be lists containing either literal strings or valid Elixir regex patterns as either string or regex literals.
If no whitelist is set, then the blacklist is used, and if no blacklist is provided, the default blacklist includes
two patterns, in both cases to ignore nodes which are created by Relx/ExRM/Distillery when using releases, in order
to setup remote shells (the first) and hot upgrade scripting (the second), the patterns can be found in this repo's
`config/config.exs` file, and you can find a quick example below:

```elixir
config :swarm,
  node_whitelist: [~r/^myapp-[\d]@.*$]
```

The above will only allow nodes named something like `myapp-1@somehost` to be included in Swarm's clustering. **NOTE**:
It is important to understand that this does not prevent those nodes from connecting to the cluster, only that Swarm will
not include those nodes in it's distribution algorithm, or communicate with those nodes.

## Registration/Process Grouping

Swarm is intended to be used by registering processes *before* they are created, and letting Swarm start
them for you on the proper node in the cluster. This is done via `register_name/4`. You may also register
processes the normal way, i.e. `GenServer.start_link({:via, :swarm, name}, ...)`. Swarm will manage these
registrations, and replicate them across the cluster, however these processes will not be moved in response
to cluster topology changes.

Swarm also offers process grouping, similar to the way `gproc` does properties. You "join" a process to a group
after it's started, (beware of doing so in `init/1` outside of a Task, or it will deadlock), with `Swarm.join/2`. 
You can then publish messages (i.e. `cast`) with
`Swarm.publish/2`, and/or call all processes in a group and collect results (i.e. `call`) with `Swarm.multi_call/2` or
`Swarm.multi_call/3`. Leaving a group can be done with `Swarm.leave/2`, but will automatically be done when a process
dies. Join/leave can be used to do pubsub like things, or perform operations over a group of related processes.

## Debugging/Troubleshooting

By configuring Swarm with `debug: true` and setting Logger's log level to `:debug`, you can get much more
information about what it is doing during operation to troubleshoot issues.

To dump the tracker's state, you can use `:sys.get_state(Swarm.Tracker)` or `:sys.get_status(Swarm.Tracker)`.
The former will dump the tracker state including what nodes it's tracking, what nodes are in the hash ring,
and the state of the interval tree clock. The latter will dump more detailed process info, including the current
function and it's arguments. This is particularly useful if it appears that the tracker is stuck and not doing
anything. If you do find such things, please gist all of these results and open an issue so that I can fix these
issues if they arise.

## Example

The following example shows a simple case where workers are dynamically created in response
to some events under a supervisor, and we want them to be distributed across the cluster and
be discoverable by name from anywhere in the cluster. Swarm is a perfect fit for this
situation.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Supervisor do
  @moduledoc """
  This is the supervisor for the worker processes you wish to distribute
  across the cluster, Swarm is primarily designed around the use case
  where you are dynamically creating many workers in response to events. It
  works with other use cases as well, but that's the ideal use case.
  """
  use Supervisor

  def start_link() do
    Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, [], name: __MODULE__)
  end

  def init(_) do
    children = [
      worker(MyApp.Worker, [], restart: :temporary)
    ]
    supervise(children, strategy: :simple_one_for_one)
  end

  @doc """

  """
  def register(worker_name) do
    {:ok, _pid} = Supervisor.start_child(__MODULE__, [worker_name])
  end
end

  @moduledoc """

  random recurring interval to stdout.

  def start_link(name) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, [name])
  end

  def init([name]) do
    {:ok, {name, :rand.uniform(5_000)}, 0}
  end

  # in cluster topology, valid response values are:

  end
